# hyper-casual-Mobile-Web-App-Game
A simple hyper-casual web-app mobile game I built, just to brush up my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The game works by detecting a user's swipe (left and right), and then moves the ball accordingly.
There are barriers which are generated with a random width, but will definitely accomodate for the size of the ball.
The speed of the barrier's movement towards the ball is decided at random for a specific amount of time.

The goal of the game, is to make sure that the ball can pass through the barrier as much as it can. 

Feel free to test the game here (On Mobile Devices Only) : https://roshenmaghhan.github.io/hyper-casual-Mobile-Web-App-Game/
