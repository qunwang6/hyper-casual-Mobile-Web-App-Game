# hyper-casual-Mobile-Web-App-Game
A simple hyper-casual web-app mobile game I built, just to brush up my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The game works by detecting a user's swipe (left and right), and then moves the ball accordingly.
There are barriers which are generated with a random width, but will definitely accomodate for the size of the ball.
The speed of the barrier's movement towards the ball is decided at random for a specific amount of time.

The goal of the game, is to make sure that the ball can pass through the barrier as much as it can.
